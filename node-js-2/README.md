# Folder 1 for experimental NodeJS project

Note:

In past there was a basic JavaScript test with Mocha aka `mocha test.js` which was executed within adjacent npm script `npm test`.
And it was working (using `describe()` in `test.js`).

I didn't want to install additional NodeJS packages I gave it up, and used `node:test` tool.

So to test basic JavaScript function directly with NodeJS:

- `node --test ./test.js`

or

- `npm test`
